These migrations are required to change the old database to work with new code. Run them in this order:
new_table_migrations.sql
race_migration.sql
time_migration.sql
event_migration.sql

After the database has been successfully migrated, the above files should be deleted and this file should be deleted to avoid any issues with "migrating" multiple times
