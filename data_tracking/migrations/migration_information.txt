These migrations are required to change the old database to work with new code. Make sure you create a safe copy of the database before running them. Run them in this order:
new_table_migrations.sql
database_cascade_delete_prep.sql (make sure you open the file and read it before you run it)
remove_corrupted_events.sql 
database_cascade_restrict_prep.sql (make sure you open the file and read it before you run it)
race_migration.sql
time_migration.sql
event_migration.sql



After the database has been successfully migrated, the above files should be deleted and this file should be deleted to avoid any issues with "migrating" multiple times
