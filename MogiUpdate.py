This module does all the heavy lifting for the commands ?rtmogiupdate and ?ctmogiupdate
Interestingly, we have to recreate Lorenzi's table text parser without any knowledge, except for trying different things on his website and seeing how his parser reacts
Even if we don't recreate his parser exactly, if it's close enough and handles how people normally table, this will be sufficient,
since we'll just "give up" if their table isn't normal
