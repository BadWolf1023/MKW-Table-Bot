This directory contains all of table bot's data.
Generally speaking, this directory is where Table Bot saves all of its data before shutting down.
This directory is loaded when Table Bot starts. 

There are no files in this directory since either the data is private, or the data is temporary between shutdowns.
However, the files that are normal in this directory are:
