**We finished our mogi. How do I submit the table to Reporters/Updaters?**
• If you are tabling on MKW Table Bot and do not have any subs:
Use `{SERVER_PREFIX}rtupdate tiernumber` for Regular Tracks, or `{SERVER_PREFIX}ctupdate tiernumber` for Custom Tracks.

• If you are making the table on Lorenzi's website:
Use `{SERVER_PREFIX}rtupdate tiernumber tabletext` for Regular Tracks, or `{SERVER_PREFIX}ctupdate tiernumber tabletext` for Custom Tracks.
*Q:* What's "tabletext"? What format should subs be in?
*A:* Check out this example: <https://bit.ly/3BB9zwr>

*Important:* These commands only work if the mogi had no subs, or if all of subs were perfectly between GPs (that is, the sub came in on race #5 or race #9). If someone subbed in in the middle of a GP (eg race #7), you'll need to ping a Reporter and ask them to manually post the table.
*Important:* If your table submission contains a player that has not been placed yet, you'll need to ping a Reporter and ask them to manually post the table.
*Note:* Doing a squad queue? Put squadqueue for `tiernumber`. Otherwise, put the number of the tier you played in (eg 2).
