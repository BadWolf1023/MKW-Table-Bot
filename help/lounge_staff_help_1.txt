**How do I want to approve or deny a table submission?**
• To approve a table submission, in the table submission channel, do `{SERVER_PREFIX}approve submissionID`
• To deny a table submission, in the table submission channel, do `{SERVER_PREFIX}deny submissionID (reason)`. Providing a reason is optional, but consider putting why it was denied along with pinging the person who submitted the table.
*Q:* What do I put for submissionID?
*A:* Each submission gets a number and is displayed on the submission. See here: <https://bit.ly/3ByL2rX>

**How can I view table submissions that haven't been approved or denied yet?**
Use `{SERVER_PREFIX}pending` in the table submission channel to get a list of all the submissions that haven't been approved or denied yet.
