***Beta Command***:
**mergeroom**: Use this command with caution, as it’s not as functional as most would like it to be. This command is merely for merging rooms when a room dies, and you don’t want to have 2 separate tables. This command should work perfectly if there are no subs. With subs, it will generally only work if the room changes between gps, as if the room changes in the middle of a gp, in all normal cases, a sub should not be able to join. To run this command, after you have finished the first race of the new room, run ?mergeroom <yourLoungeName>. If something goes wrong with this command, always ping table bot support.


***Other Commands***:
**setprefix <prefix>**: Changes the server's prefix for the bot to prefix. Only admins can do this.

**stats**: Displays stats of the bot.

**quickstart**: Describes the 2 commands you actually need to know to use this bot. Useful if you cried when you saw how long this help document was.
