**We played a race that shouldn't be scored on the table. How can I remove it?**
You can remove a race by doing `{SERVER_PREFIX}removerace racenumber`.
*Note:* Because this command is highly unstable, if you are going to remove a race, do it immediately after it has been played, prior to doing any other editing commands.
*Example:* `{SERVER_PREFIX}removerace 5` will remove the 5th race from the table.
