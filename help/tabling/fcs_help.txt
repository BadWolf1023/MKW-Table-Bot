**How do I see a list of FCs for everyone who has been in the room?**
Do `{SERVER_PREFIX}fcs` to display a list of all players in the room with their FCs, along with their LoungeNames, if they have one.

**Terminology:**
*FC* means friend code on Mario Kart Wii.
*LoungeName* is the name that someone has in Mogi Lounge.
