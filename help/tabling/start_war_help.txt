**How do I start a table with MKW Table Bot?**
To start a table, use the command `{SERVER_PREFIX}startwar warFormat numberOfTeams (FC/LoungeName/Mention/RXX) (psb=yes/no) (gps=numberOfGPs) (miis=yes/no)`
Let's break that down. It's not as complicated as it seems.
- *warFormat* is the format your room is. For example, FFA, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5, and 6v6 are all valid for *warFormat*
- *numberOfTeams* is simply the number of teams that are playing. For example, a 2v2v2 has 3 teams.
- If you do not give a *FC/LoungeName/Mention/RXX*, MKW Table Bot will try to find you in a room. Otherwise, MKW Table Bot will try to start a table for what is given to *FC/LoungeName/Mention/RXX* (eg starting a table for a given FC).
- If you want to ignore large time errors, use *psb=yes* - otherwise, to display large time errors, use *psb=no* - if *psb=* is not specified, the default in the Discord server will be used.
- The default number of GPs on tables for MKW Table Bot tables is 3 GPs. If you wanted to table 8 GPs, you would use *gps=8*. You can make the table any number of GPs, up to 15 GPs. If *gps=* is not specified, the default in the Discord server will be used.
- If you want the mii heads displayed beneath the table, use *miis=yes* - and if you don't, use *miis=no* - if *miis=* is not specified, the default in the Discord server will be used.
*Note:* `{SERVER_PREFIX}sw` and `{SERVER_PREFIX}starttable` work as well!
*Note:* If you are not registered in Mogi Lounge, you cannot start a table for yourself. Instead, you must give your FC that you're playing on.
*IMPORTANT:* This command ONLY works if the room has **finished** at least one race.
*Example:* `{SERVER_PREFIX}sw 2v2 6` will try find you in a room and start a table with 6 teams having 2 players on each team.
*Example:* `{SERVER_PREFIX}sw ffa 10 1234-5678-9012` will try to find that FC in a room and start an FFA table with 10 players.
*Example:* `{SERVER_PREFIX}sw 5v5 2 psb=yes gps=5 miis=no` will try find you in a room and start a table with 2 teams having 5 players on each team. Large time errors will be hidden, the table will be 5 GPs, and mii pictures beneath the table will be off.
*Example:* `{SERVER_PREFIX}sw 6v6 2 r1234567 gps=1` will try to load that room (see Terminology section above) and start a table with 2 teams having 6 players on each team. The table will be 1 GP.

**Terminology:**
*FC* means friend code on Mario Kart Wii. If you are not registered in Mogi Lounge, you'll need to give commands your friend code.
*LoungeName* is the name that someone has in Mogi Lounge.
*Mention* means you ping the person. Mentions only work if the person being mentioned is registered in Mogi Lounge.
*RXX* is the number in your room's mkwx URL. It looks like r#######. For example, the rxx number of <https://wiimmfi.de/stats/mkwx/list/r1234567> is r1234567.
