**We finished our mogi. How do I submit the table to Reporters/Updaters?**
_If you are tabling on MKW Table Bot and do not have any subs:_
For RTs (Regular Tracks), use the `{SERVER_PREFIX}rtupdate tiernumber` command. For CTs (Custom Tracks), use the `{SERVER_PREFIX}ctupdate tiernumber` command.

_If you are making the table on Lorenzi's website:_
For RTs (Regular Tracks), use the `{SERVER_PREFIX}rtupdate tiernumber tabletext` command. For CTs (Regular Tracks), use the `{SERVER_PREFIX}ctupdate tiernumber tabletext` command. Check out this example: <https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/863238405269749760/865072461157367818/unknown.png>

*Important Note:* These commands only work if the mogi had no subs, or if all of subs were perfectly between GPs (that is, the sub came in on race #5 or race #9). If someone subbed in in the middle of a GP (eg race #7), you'll need to ping a Reporter and ask them to manually post the table.
*Important Note:* If your table submission contains a player that has not been placed yet, you'll need to ping a Reporter and ask them to manually post the table.
*Note:* Doing a squad queue? Put squadqueue for `tiernumber`.

LOUNGE_CT_MOGI_UPDATE_TERMS = {'ctmogiupdate', 'cttableupdate', 'ctupdatemogi', 'ctupdate'}

Bosses, Arbitrators, Updaters, and Reporters in Lounge can use these commands to approve, deny, or check pending submissions.
