TO DO:
Turn this into more readable documentation.

To update strike counts, use the !strike command.
Specify RT or CT, the number of strikes, and the player names.
If any players reach the strike limit, the bot will mention that in the summary channel.
Example #1: To give Cheeseburger and French Fries two RT strikes each, type !strike rt 2 Cheeseburger, French Fries.
Example #2: To remove four CT strikes from Milkshake, type !strike ct -4 Milkshake.

To update tables submitted through Table Bot, use the !submit command.
Specify the Table Bot table ID; confirm the names, scores, race counts, subs, and MMR changes on the update preview that presents; and then react with :white_check_mark: to confirm the update (or :x: to deny it).
The bot will automatically run the @RankBot command for promotions/demotions after uploading an image of the update to the summary channel.
Example #3: To update table #9001, type !submit 9001, verify the results, and then react with :white_check_mark:.

For manually-submitted tables, first update the table manually in the site as per usual, and then use the !table command.
Specify RT or CT and the Lounge Leaderboard table ID.
An image of the update will be uploaded to the summary channel.
Example #4: To generate an image of the manually-updated CT table #1183, type !table ct 1183 (https://mariokartboards.com/lounge/ladder/table.php?wid=1183&type=ct).

Please continue to react to strikes and penalties as you update them. Let us know if you have any questions or encounter any issues.
